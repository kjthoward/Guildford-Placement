    "Other" => "These images have something present in them that does not fit into one of the other 12 categories.",
    "MagView" => "Magnification Views (MagViews) are images that use a small magnification table to brins the breast closer to the x-ray source and further away from the film plate. This allows the acquisition of 'zoomed in' images of the region of interest. Magnification views provide a clearer assessment of the borders and the tissue structures of a suspicious area or a mass.",
    "Thin Breast Artefact" => "During a mammogram the breast is compressed to even out the thickness so all the tissue can be visualised, spread out the tissue so small abnormalities arenâ€™t hidden by overlying tissue. If the breast compresses to less than 2cm in thickness the compression paddle edges may be seen in the image, showing up as bright white corners.",
    "Not Acceptable for Testing" => "This is a broad category of images which do not have a clearly defined full breast or have other objects in view, such as biopsy needles.",
    "Silicone Implant" => "These images have a silicone breast implant present, which shows up as a large, bright, white object.",
    "Medical Port" => "These images contain a medical port, such as a central line port.",

This can occur if the subject isn't positioned correctly and their hand rests between the x-ray source and the detector. Depending on in the obstruction covers any area of the breast, these images may not need to be repeated.",,

Depending on in the obstruction covers any area of the breast, these images may not need to be repeated.",
    "Metal Clip" => "If an area within the breast is hard to find/biopsy sometimes small metal clips will be inserted into the tissue to help that area be relocated in future. As these are made from titanium, which is non magnetic and body safe, they are often left in after the scan/biopsy as removing them carries more risk than leaving them in.",
    "Saline Implant" => "These images have a saline breast implant present, which shows up as a large, bright grey object. Sometimes the port used for adjusting the volume of saline can also be seen.",
    "Other Type of Implant" => "These images contain another type of implanted deviced, not for breast augmentation, but is larger than the small metal clips used for marking areas.",
